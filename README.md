X-rays spectroscopy is used to investigate the elemental composition and chemical states of materials through an energy spectrum. However, in high input-count-rate scenarios, the pile-up effect occurs, distorting the energy
spectrum and affecting measurement accuracy. Currently, deep learning methods have been increasingly applied to pile-up correction. Nevertheless, there is a lack of open datasets for improving and measuring the
performance of various algorithms. Therefore, the first open time-series nuclear pulse dataset was constructed using the Allpix Squared simulator, which is a well-recognized simulation framework developed
by CERN (European Council for Nuclear Research). The dataset contains time-series nuclear pulse data for over a dozen elements. Detailed and diverse annotations are provided to support various deep-learning
models.
